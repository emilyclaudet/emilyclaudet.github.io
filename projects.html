                    <p>Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work on several indie game projects, from narrative adventures to cozy pixel art experiences. Each project has taught me something different about storytelling, game design, and the collaborative process of bringing creative visions to life.</p>

                                <p><strong>A top-down 2D adventure game about a young alchemist uncovering the mystery behind wisps.</strong></p>
                                
                                <p>This was my first commercial game release, developed over two years with a small team of three. I focused on narrative design, level design, and business operations—everything from writing dialogue trees to setting up our Steam store page.</p>
                                
                                <p>The game explores themes of curiosity, loss, and discovery through the lens of a young protagonist who must navigate both magical mysteries and personal growth. We built it in Unity, and the experience taught me invaluable lessons about scope management, player feedback integration, and the importance of iterative design.</p>

                                <p>Currently working on this project part-time as Creative Producer at Bolero Games Studio. It's a much more intimate and contemplative experience than my previous work, focusing on quiet moments, daily routines, and the healing power of companionship.</p>
                                
                                <p>The game explores how we process loss and find meaning in simple, everyday interactions. The pixel art style creates a warm, nostalgic atmosphere that complements the gentle pacing and emotional depth of the narrative.</p>
                                
                                <p>My role involves shaping the overall creative vision, coordinating between team members, and ensuring that every element—from the writing to the visual design—serves the central emotional experience we're trying to create.</p>

                                <p><strong>A visual novel about babysitting two kids in a wealthy US east-coast neighborhood.</strong></p>
                                
                                <p>This project was a collaboration with my sister—I handled the writing and programming while she created all the artwork. It was an experiment in social commentary wrapped in the format of a lighthearted visual novel.</p>
                                
                                <p>The story explores class dynamics, family relationships, and the perspective of an outsider looking into a privileged world. Through the lens of a babysitter, players navigate complex social situations and make choices that affect both the story and the relationships between characters.</p>
                                
                                <p>Working in Ren'Py gave us the flexibility to focus on storytelling and character development. The project taught me a lot about branching narratives and how to balance player agency with authored storytelling.</p>

                    <p>I'm always interested in exploring new storytelling formats and game mechanics. Whether it's integrating AI tools into the development process or experimenting with different narrative structures, I'm excited about the evolving landscape of indie game development.</p>
